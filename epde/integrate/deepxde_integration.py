"""DeepXDE backend for ``SolverBasedFitness`` -- fixed-coefficient PINN with
an observation term, scored on held-out time.

One solve per trajectory. The loss has no tuned weights::

    loss = sum_e  mean(residual_e^2)          / Var(target_e, train window)
         + sum_v  mean((u_v - u_obs_v)^2)     / Var(u_obs_v,   train window)

* the residual uses the candidate's OWN fitted coefficients
  (``weights_final``, from EPDE's finite-difference design matrix) -- they are
  fixed, the net only has to produce a field that satisfies them;
* the observation term (``PointSetBC``) supervises the observed field on the
  first ``train_frac`` of the time levels only, while the residual is
  enforced on collocation points over the WHOLE domain;
* each term is divided by the variance of its own channel, so both are a
  fraction of their signal left unexplained and weight 1 is commensurate.

The caller scores the solution on the held-out time levels
(``time_split``), where only the candidate equation drives it. That is the
design the PINN experiments on Allen-Cahn validated: the fit on the training
window barely separated the true equation from a wrong one, the held-out
tail separated them ~20x on every seed.

Replaces the former IC/BC strategies, which (a) were fed the equation's
TARGET-term values as if they were the field ``u`` and (b) searched for
IC/BC points at the full-grid edges among inner-domain coordinates, so 2-D/3-D
solves got no conditions at all and 1-D solves pinned ``u(t0) = 0``.

    return orig_loss``) WITHOUT incrementing ``n_iter``. DeepXDE's
    ``_train_pytorch_lbfgs`` then reads the unchanged counter and evaluates its
    convergence test ``prev_n_iter == n_iter - 1`` as ``prev == prev - 1``,
    which is False; it adds ``n_iter - prev_n_iter == 0`` to the step counter,
    leaves ``prev_n_iter`` where it was, and spins on
    ``while prev_n_iter < maxiter`` forever, re-printing one row.

    The condition has never fired here -- gtol has never held at entry -- but
    ``lbfgs_gtol_rel`` is a knob on exactly that test, so enabling it would hang
    a solve rather than stop it. This reinstalls DeepXDE's loop ON THE INSTANCE

    candidates are otherwise scored at materially different degrees of
    convergence (measured 5829-7982 iterations against ``maxiter=15000``) with
    nothing saying which stopped why.

    ``model.lbfgs_exit['reason']``:

    * ``'gtol'`` -- the gradient test ended the phase (DeepXDE's absolute
      ``gtol``, or ``lbfgs_gtol_rel``'s). A ``step`` that adds no iteration is
      ALWAYS this: the entry return above is the only way ``step`` can finish
      without iterating. A gradient stop mid-``step`` ends that call early and
      the next one returns at entry, so it lands here too.
    * ``'maxiter'`` -- the iteration budget ran out. The last ``step`` is
      bounded to what the budget still allows, so ``iterations`` is exactly
      ``maxiter`` -- not, as it once was, up to ``iter_per_step - 1`` past it.
    * ``'maxeval'`` -- a ``step``'s only iteration used up that call's
      evaluation budget (``fun_per_step``); a matter of tiny budgets.
    * ``'converged'`` -- DeepXDE's own test (a ``step`` made exactly one
      iteration) for any other reason. Measured: the float32 line search
      returns a zero step, torch breaks, and the next call does the same.
    * ``'nonfinite'`` -- the loss or its gradient is NaN/inf: the phase
      diverged. DeepXDE's ``_test`` stops on a NaN loss, so this also
      replaces the ``stop_training`` that stop would otherwise read as.
    * ``'stop_training'`` -- a callback asked to stop.
    * ``'no_step'`` -- the optimiser holds no state after a step; nothing ran.

    A one-iteration ``step`` is where these overlap, so it is resolved in the
    order nonfinite, maxiter (what the loop itself stops on, whatever the
    gradient), gtol, maxeval, converged.

    ``model.lbfgs_exit['iterations']`` is torch's own ``n_iter``: the

    iteration it detects, so ``prev_n_iter`` alone is one short there.
