# Data sets, runs and benchmark for EPDE

This project collects the data sets of the repository in one place and gives one way
to work with all of them: load a record, check that its known law is visible in the
data, run the search, score and inspect the result, compare methods. It works the same
on Windows, Linux and macOS, from the command line, from the notebooks and from a
visual app.

What it consists of:

- **a collection of 29 records**: synthetic ordinary and partial differential
  equations with known laws and measured records (pendulums, a robot arm, a ball on a
  beam, sea surface temperature). Each record comes with its grid, its known law and
  the equivalent forms of that law that also count as correct;
- **layered settings**: one shared protocol with a single broad token pool for every
  problem, a short file per record with only what that problem needs, method variants
  for comparisons, and changes given at run time;
- **a command line, short scripts per data folder, notebooks and an app**, all on top
  of the same code;
- **a benchmark**: series of runs in parallel processes that resume after an
  interruption, with reports and confidence intervals.

The library itself and the group's original research scripts are not changed; all of
this lives next to them.

## Installation

### With uv

Choose one PyTorch build and keep it in every command:

```bash
cd projects/pic
uv sync --locked --extra cpu
uv run --locked --extra cpu python bench.py list
uv run --locked --extra cpu python bench.py run ode --noise 0
uv run --locked --extra cpu python -m ipykernel install --user --name epde-pic --display-name "EPDE PIC"
```

For NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA 12.8 use `cu128` instead of `cpu`, both for the installation
and in every run; the two options exclude each other. A run without the option may
remove PyTorch from the environment, so every example names it. The lock file pins all
versions; EPDE is installed in editable mode from this working copy.

### With pip

Python 3.11–3.13, from the repository root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate      Linux/macOS: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install torch                       # or a CUDA build from pytorch.org
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt         # required: the package declares no dependencies
pip install -r projects/pic/requirements-bench.txt
```

The commands always use EPDE from the working copy they belong to, even when another
copy is installed in the environment.

## Quick start

```bash
python projects/pic/bench.py list                    # every record
python projects/pic/bench.py info burgers            # data, known law, final settings
python projects/pic/bench.py check ac --noise 0,1,5  # is the law visible in the data
python projects/pic/bench.py run burgers --noise 1 --seed 0
python projects/pic/scripts/kdv.py --plot
```

The short scripts accept the same options as the command line (noise, seed, method
variant, changed settings, signal check, plots, output file) and can be started from
any folder.

## Settings

A run is configured in layers; a later layer wins:

1. the **shared protocol**: coordinates and sine/cosine of frequency 2 in every pool,
   powers of the variable up to 3 and of its derivatives up to 2, up to 10 terms of up
   to 2 factors, population 16, 5 epochs, finite differences — the setup of the group's
   former benchmark;
2. the **file of the record**: a larger population for systems, first derivatives for
   first-order systems, smoothing for measured data, special tokens;
3. a **method variant** compared by the benchmark;
4. **changes given at run time**.

Three values are filled for each record automatically: the boundary excluded from
fitting (10 % of every axis), the highest derivative orders (2 in time, 4 in space)
and the dimensionality of the token families.

## Data sets

The full list with classes, shapes, laws and notes is in [DATASETS.md](DATASETS.md):

- **core** — 15 synthetic problems with a known law, the main benchmark tables;
- **extended** — 3 more synthetic problems;
- **real** — 4 measured records;
- **other** — load, but are not benchmarked (no known law, missing files, or too large
  for a routine run).

A new record needs its files in the data folder, a loader that returns grids, fields
and (if known) the law in EPDE's text form, and a short settings file with what
differs from the shared protocol. The documentation and the script for the record are
then regenerated, and the signal check should confirm on clean data that the law holds
before any search is run.

## Signal check

The check evaluates the terms of the known law on the data, prepared exactly as the
search prepares them, and fits their coefficients by least squares. It reports how
much of the left-hand side the true structure explains and how much each term
contributes. A term that explains almost nothing cannot be identified under this
preprocessing. This is a diagnostic of the data, not a proof that no method can
recover the law.

```bash
python projects/pic/bench.py check pend_single --noise 0
python projects/pic/bench.py check ode --noise 0,1,5 --variant poly
```

Notes on particular records:

- **Turbulence slice:** the derivatives and external fields come from the direct
  numerical simulation. Artificial noise is not allowed: noisy fields would be compared
  with noise-free gradients.
- **Sea surface temperature:** by default the largest rectangular ocean region that is
  finite on every day is used; the original box with land masked can be loaded for
  plotting. The governing law is not known.
- **Darcy flow:** the data files are missing; the loader is kept as an unverified
  prototype.

Shapes, finiteness of the data and a non-empty region after the boundary are checked
before every search.

## Comparing methods

Besides EPDE, a sparse-regression baseline (PySINDy) runs on a library built from the
same fields, derivatives and extra tokens. Problems it cannot represent (a coefficient
in front of the time derivative, the continuity equation of Navier–Stokes) are reported
as unsupported, not as failures.

```bash
python projects/pic/bench.py campaign --datasets ode,lorenz \
    --variants default,pysindy --noise 0,1 --seeds 0-2 --workers 2 --name comparison
python projects/pic/bench.py report projects/pic/results/comparison
```

Every run of a campaign is a separate process. Repeating the command continues the same
campaign; failed runs can be retried. A run is identified by its settings, data, code
and dependency versions: changing any of them requires a new campaign, so old and new
results are never mixed.

The report shows the success rates with 95 % Wilson intervals, a ranking by problem
class on the problems every variant supports, and run times. Planned and unsupported
runs are listed separately; errors and timeouts count as failures.

## Notebooks

| notebook | content |

| 00 · Quick start | one complete run, step by step, and how to read the result |
| 01 · Search settings | the search object, its settings and defaults, settings stored in files |
| 02 · Preprocessing | domain, data, derivatives, supplied derivatives, signal check |
| 03 · Search space and fit | token families, the search, the Pareto front and its scoring |
| 04 · Evolutionary optimizer | the evolutionary loop, objectives, sparsity, budget |

The tutorials separate data inspection, checks of the known law, discovery and
reconstruction. Where a search is performed, its selected equation is compared with
the data: the left-hand side computed from the data against the value predicted by
the equation and, for ordinary differential equations, the integrated solution
against the record. Reconstruction starts at the first retained interior point.
The oscillator lesson also demonstrates discovery on the first 70% of raw samples
and forecasting the remaining 30%, with candidate selection using training data only.

The notebooks run missing searches themselves and reuse a saved result only when its
settings, data, code and dependencies match exactly. Long searches are not run inside
the notebooks.

## Visual app

A front end to the same code, grouped by step. Every page starts with a minimal set of
controls and its defaults are the stored settings of the record; further choices are under
*More options*, and every page explains itself under *About this page*.

| group | page | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| Start | How EPDE works | the stages of the algorithm and a short live evolution |
| Explore data | Data sets | browse the records, plot them, read the known laws |
| | Signal check | is the known law visible at a given noise level; contribution of every term |
| | Derivatives | derivative methods compared on noisy data, with their error |
| Find equations | Run a search | choose a record and press Start; the result shows the found equation, whether it is the known law, and the equation against the data |
| | Your data | upload a table, a matrix or an archive and search for its equation |
| Review | Results | every saved search: from the app, the notebooks and the campaigns |
| | Benchmark | start a campaign, follow it, read the comparison |

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra cpu --extra app
uv run --locked --extra cpu --extra app streamlit run app/Home.py
```

Ordinary dataset and uploaded-data searches run in separate processes and save the
common benchmark record, so their results can be inspected in a notebook. The short
optimizer and chronological forecasting lessons have their own evidence records;
their computations are isolated from Streamlit sessions as well.

## Checks

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s projects/pic/tests -v
```

Tests cover data, term parsing, metrics, run identity, process lifecycle and small
executable optimizer/API lessons. Full dataset campaigns run separately. Checks that
need files missing from the repository are skipped and reported as such.

### Reading and running in the visual app

The existing Streamlit pages also serve as interactive documentation. Each page includes expandable reading notes explaining the question it answers, how to interpret its output and a small exercise using its existing controls. The algorithm page runs a short real evolutionary search and displays observed epoch fronts. No separate website is required.

From `projects/pic`, start the local application with:

```bash
uv run --locked --extra cpu --extra app streamlit run app/Home.py --server.address 127.0.0.1
```

GitHub Pages cannot serve the Python Streamlit application. Local execution uses the
application above; Community Cloud runs Python on its server. Published experiment
folders retain raw run records, settings, source identities and validation evidence.
Notebook outputs distinguish discovery, reconstruction and unseen-data forecasting;
optional extended comparisons must be enabled explicitly before running them.

The architecture sources are included in `architecture/`; they describe framework packages and the benchmark workflow.
