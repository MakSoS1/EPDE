# Notebook execution record

All eleven notebooks were executed from a clean state on 9 October 2026 with
`scripts/execute_notebooks.py --name notebook_execution_2026-10-09`: saved outputs
were cleared, a new empty search cache was used, and no earlier search result was
reused. CPU, Python 3.13, BLAS threads 1.

`manifest.json` records, per notebook, the status, the source hash, start and end
times and the duration and status of every cell. All 135 code cells completed without
errors. Notebooks 08 and 10 read the campaign in `../baseline_clean_2026-10-09`
and were executed again after it finished; they start no searches themselves.

Executing a notebook is not the same as recovering an equation: the outputs state,
for every search, whether the discovered structure matches the known law.
