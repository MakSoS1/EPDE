"""
Shared helpers for the double pendulum CV-vs-baseline PINN comparison,
generic-form version.

We treat the system as a HYPOTHESIS to verify: two candidate equations in
(theta1, theta2), each rearranged so a specific second derivative is the
target and the rest are RHS terms with unknown coefficients. The discovery
question is whether the per-window OLS-fitted coefficients are (a)
consistent across windows and (b) close to the values we secretly know
the right form would give.

Candidate equations (encoded in `EQUATIONS` below):

    Eq 1 (target = theta1_tt, K = 3):
        theta1_tt = c1*(theta2_tt*cos(theta1-theta2))
                  + c2*(theta2_t^2  *sin(theta1-theta2))
                  + c3*sin(theta1)
        true coefs  ~ [-0.5, -0.5, -g]

    Eq 2 (target = theta2_tt, K = 3):
        theta2_tt = c1*(theta1_tt*cos(theta1-theta2))
                  + c2*(theta1_t^2  *sin(theta1-theta2))
                  + c3*sin(theta2)
        true coefs  ~ [-1.0, 1.0, -g]

(Equal-mass, equal-length double pendulum: m1=m2=L1=L2=1. The factor of
-g lives inside the gravity-feature coefficient -- features are kept as
raw observables, mirroring how NS keeps `u_xx` raw and lets `theta_true`
carry the viscosity 0.01.)

Per equation, OLS over collocation points in each time window gives a
K-vector theta_i. CV^2 across windows is the consistency metric. The
true coefficients are not used in the OLS itself -- only in the
anchored-MSE flavour of the CV penalty (and for diagnostics).

The cross-coupling features (Eq 1 uses theta2_tt as a feature, Eq 2
uses theta1_tt) are fine: at every collocation point the OLS uses the
network's autograd `theta_tt`, which is just another column of the
design matrix. The two residuals must be satisfied jointly for the
network to be self-consistent.

    This is raw cv2 with the part of the window-to-window variance the
    window fits' own standard errors already predict SUBTRACTED, and a
    bounded singularity-free denominator. It separates the two cases raw
    cv2 conflates: score ~ 0 with SMALL ``se_rel`` = genuinely consistent
    recovery; score ~ 0 with HUGE ``se_rel`` = no evidence (degenerate /
    parked trajectory -- ridge-collapsed thetas agreeing about nothing).

    TRUTH-FREE: uses only (target, features) from the net's trajectory.
    As a LOSS it must be paired with a collapse blocker (physics + IC):
    a fully degenerate state has zero evidence and therefore ZERO het --
    the score rewards degeneracy, it cannot forbid it. Windows whose
    Gram is non-invertible or whose diag of the inverse is non-positive
    contribute no evidence (weight 0). With heavily OVERLAPPING windows
    the theta_w are correlated, so the chi-square calibration (df = usable
    windows - 1) is conservative: correlated sampling deviations shrink Q,
    biasing tau2 toward 0 -- genuine drift still dominates.

    With ``detach_calibration=True`` (default) the evidence weights
    (s2-derived w, S1, S2, C, df) are DETACHED from the graph: the
    gradient of the score flows only through the per-window thetas and
    their weighted mean. Without it, a het LOSS has a second descent
    direction -- inflate your own standard errors until the evidence
    (and the loss) vanishes -- i.e. the degeneracy-reward hole becomes an
    active gradient incentive. Diagnostics (no_grad) are unaffected.

    ``score_raw`` is the UNBOUNDED form, the ``var / mu^2`` shape of
    ``epde.operators.common.survival.heterogeneity_raw_scores``: the same
    tau2 over the bare squared level. It keeps ordering two states that
    both saturate ``score`` near 1, and its gradient does not fade as the
    inconsistency grows (``score``'s does, as ``theta_bar^2/denom^2``).
    A level at float zero is clamped to machine eps rather than sent to
    inf: a loss term must stay finite, and eps is the same floor this
    function already uses for rss. Unlike the package form there is no
    unresolved-level guard -- the bounded ``score`` here has none either.

    TRUTH-FREE: theta is the global OLS recovery of the net's own
    trajectory (the evidence rule -- never a trainable parameter). As a

    exact fit floors to ZERO score, so chi -- like het -- rewards
    degeneracy, it cannot forbid it; the mcv diagnostic stays the
    watchdog.

    With ``detach_calibration=True`` (default) the calibration
    denominator ``D_j`` (including its dependence on ``c``) is DETACHED:
    the score's gradient flows through the path ``S`` -- through ``r``,
    the columns ``A``, and ``c`` via ``linalg.solve`` -- but not through
    ``D``. Otherwise the loss acquires a second descent direction --
    inflate your own signal energy (grow ``|c_j|`` or your own
    derivative amplitudes) and the score falls without the path getting
    any more constant -- the exact analog of het's
    inflate-your-own-standard-errors hole. ``c`` in the NUMERATOR stays
    attached: it is evidence, not calibration.

    The solve is ``global_ols`` -- het's guard convention (AtA-relative
    ridge PLUS an absolute ``tiny``), not ``ols_per_window``'s
    relative-only ridge: a parked net (AtA -> 0) must yield a guarded
    solve, not a LinAlgError. The ridge breaks the exact zero-sum pinning by
    ``S_N = lam*c`` -- negligible at these scales; ``s_end`` is
    returned so runs can verify it.

    ``use_floor=False`` skips the exact-fit floor: the score stays the
    raw path functional even at machine-precision fits (tiny, but never
    an exact zero cliff). The float32 DP run measured the floor as an
    ATTRACTOR, not a benign self-limit -- the net drove both equations
    to near-exact fits of a WRONG (gravity-free) system where the
    floored chi read exactly [0,0,0] -- so the no-floor variant (paired
    with float64 inputs, which alone would push the floor down to
