"""Gate tables, integrity checks and paired contrasts for gate.py results.

usage
  python analyze.py [--tags baseline,stage1_start,stage1,stage1_end,stage1_basis]
                    [--systems ac,duffing,burgers]

Per system:
  1. INTEGRITY -- nothing below is read until these hold:
     * duplicate controls bitwise equal to their originals;
     * the pre-patch baseline B equals the stored Sep 18 2026 values (AC, Duffing);
     * B-ctl run at the START / END of the Stage-1 batch equals the pre-patch B
       (the patch left the default path alone / nothing drifted in the batch);
     * null arms (``null_of``) equal their reference arm bitwise;
     * paired arms start from the same initial weights as S0 (pairing digest);
     * trace replay at the shipped cap equals the plain solve.
  2. GATE TABLE -- per-seed gate = ln(RMSE_wrong / RMSE_true), min over seeds, the
     bar (> 0 on EVERY seed). Trace arms are also read at the WALL-CLOCK budget
     T_B (median seconds of the plain shipped-recipe solves on that system) and
     at 0.9 T_B; a gate read where the arm had already hit its iteration cap
     before the budget is flagged as censored.
  3. CONTRASTS -- pre-specified paired contrasts of the per-seed gate
     (pinn_common.contrast; unresolved rows print mde and seeds_needed).
Then, across systems, the pre-registered ranking: eligible = every solve finite
and the bar passed at T_B and 0.9 T_B on every system; score = the minimum gate
over (system, seed) at T_B, in nats; arms within 0.10 of the top tie.
